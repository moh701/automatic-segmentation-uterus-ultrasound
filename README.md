# üè• Automatic Segmentation of the Uterus, Endometrium, and Myometrium Using Ultrasound Images  

## üìñ Overview  
This project focuses on the **automatic segmentation of the endometrium using ultrasound images** using a **U-Net deep learning model**. The dataset consists of **DICOM ultrasound scans**, which are used for training and testing the model.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note on Patient Data Privacy**  
Due to **privacy and ethical restrictions**, the original dataset **cannot be shared** in this repository. However, we provide instructions on how you can **prepare your own dataset** to replicate this study.

## üöÄ Project Workflow  
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection (NOT INCLUDED)**
- The dataset consists of **DICOM ultrasound images**.
- The dataset is **not publicly available** due to patient privacy regulations.
- Users should **use their own medical ultrasound datasets** to train the model.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing**
- Convert `.mat` segmentations into **JPG format**.
- Extract **grayscale B-mode and CEUS images**.
- Normalize pixel intensities for model consistency.
- Implemented in:
  - **`convert-mat-to-jpg.m`** - Converts `.mat` segmentation masks into JPG images.
  - **`delineationScript_Eva.m`** - Loads DICOM frames and applies manual delineation.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Augmentation**
- Augments images to **increase dataset diversity** and reduce overfitting.
- Includes:
  - Rotation
  - Flipping
  - Contrast adjustment
- Implemented in:
  - **`augmented.ipynb`** - Applies data augmentation techniques.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Training the Model (U-Net)**
- A **U-Net model** is trained to segment the **endometrium region**.
- Training includes:
  - **Preprocessing grayscale images**
  - **Splitting data (80% train, 20% test)**
  - **Training the U-Net model**
  - **Saving the trained weights**
- Implemented in:
  - **`create_h5_with_aug.ipynb`** - Prepares dataset for training.
  - **`prediction.ipynb`** - Trains and evaluates the U-Net model.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation and Prediction**
- The trained model predicts segmentation masks for test images.
- The model's performance is evaluated using:
  - **Dice Coefficient**
  - **Intersection over Union (IoU)**
- Implemented in:
  - **`first_frame_of_six_of_data_test_with_each_dice_and_iou.py`** - Evaluates segmentation quality.
  - **`prediction.ipynb`** - Runs inference on test images.
